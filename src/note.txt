 tables for entities
Db inheritance
------------------------
1. MappedSuperClass -> no table for parent class, but individual for each child class.
Child class gets the attributes from parent, and they become columns in child class table.

Hibernate Dialect
---------------------
The dialect specifies the type of database used in hibernate so that hibernate generate appropriate type of SQL statements.
For connecting any hibernate application with the database, it is required to provide the configuration of SQL dialect.

ddl.auto : create,update,verify
Create : everytime you start the application, it will drop all the tables and recreate them. High chances of losing data.
Update : everyime you start the application, only the update changes are implemented.
Verify : it does not create/udpate anything, it just verifies if the DB has all the tables/columns/mappings as mentioned in the entities. -> Generally used in companies, for production

Local development -> create or update
Production -> verify [ generally tables via separate scripts like FlyWay, Liquibase ]
